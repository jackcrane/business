# Supply Chain Management

> Connecting and integrating all parties of the distribution system in order to satisfy customers

Focuses on
- Procurement
- Logistics
  - Inbound logistics (raw materials)
  - Outbound logistics (product)
  - Third-party logistics

Operations are often the most public and visible aspect of the supply chain

## Procurement

Procurement (aka purchasing) is the buying of all materials needed by the organization

- Aim is to obtain items of desired quality in the right quantities at the lowest possible cost
- Companies may be able to make some component parts more economically and efficiently
- Can arrange to lease the item from another company
- What the firm does depends on cost, availibility, and supplier reliability

## Managing inventory

Inventory is all raw materials, components, completed or partially completed products, and pieces of equipment a firm uses.

- Finished-goods inventory
- Work-in-process inventory
- Raw materials inventory

### Inventory control

|Economic order quantity model|Find the optimum number of items to purchase that will cost the least in the long term (purchasing, shipping, handling)|
|Just-in-time inventory management|Reduces waste as things are delivered just as they are needed. Risky because a supplier/shipment may be late, which holds up your business|
|Material-requirements planning||

### Outsourcing

Oursourcing is the contracting of manufacturing or other tasks to independent companies

- Globalization requires supply chain managers to improve speed and balance resources
- Linked with competitive advantage
- May raise negative public opinion

Results in higher risk than being vertically integrated. Control is lost, and you need to determine how to deal with the loss of control.

### Routing

The sequence of operations through which the product must pass. The sequence depends on the product specifications.

Basically a set of instructions to produce a product. Typically is designed by the engineering department and implemented by management.

### Scheduling

The assignment of required tasks to departments or specific machines, workers, or teams.

### Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

PERT Identifies all the major activities required to complete a project

- Arranges activities in a sequence or path
- Determines the critical path (Path that requires the longest time from start to finish)
- Estimates the time required for each event
