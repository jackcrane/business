Product and finanical accountability are linked with accounting and MIS. Product and Service Delivery are linked by operations, and Service Delivery and Financial Accountability are linked with Accounting and HR.

Marketing really cares about the financial stability of the company, because it changes the prices they are advertising.

## Role of marketing

Marketing manages connections between the organization and the customer. What can we do for the customer?

Marketing monitors the *financial performance*, *customer relationship performance*, and *new product performance* of managed connections.

### Strategic plan

If you are a customer focused company, marketing is a **totally strategic operation**.

Often times, someone creates a company around a great idea. This results in a *product-focused* organization.

> Marketing is not a function of buisness like Accounting or HR, but is *the* function of buisness
