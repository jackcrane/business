## Creating value with Marketing

- Value is a customer's subjective assessment of benefits relative to costs in determining the worth of a product
- *Customer value = customer benefits - customer costs*
  - Benefits are anything a buyer receives in exchange.
  - Costs are anything a buyer gives up to obtain a product's benefits.

## The marketing concept

- Ideat that an organization should try to satisfy customers' needs through coordinated activities that also allow it to achieve its own goals. 
- Businesses must:
  - Find out what customers desire
  - Develop the good, service, or idea to satisfy that want
  - Get the product to the customer
  - Continually alter, adapt, and add products to keep pace with changing customer demands.

# Marketing: The function of business

> Marketing and innovation are the two chief functions of business. You get paid for creating a customer, which is marketing. And yuo get paid for creating a new dimension of perfomance.

## Push - pull theory

### Product

The combination of your company, what your competitors can provide, and what the customers are requiring. Once any of the factors change, the product will have to change as well.

The positioning of a product is `positioning = differentiation + segmentation`. How is our product differentiated from the competition?
