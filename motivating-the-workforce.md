# Why can a manager not make work feel like play

At work, you have an objective, goal, and teamwork. Sounds like sports?

Many managers cannot enjoy themselves and get work done at the same time. Managers fear loosing control of the control and productivity of their workers. Studies exist that support the most important thing is motivation rather than money to get someone to work hard.

If you take it to a point where you are just having fun, thats not good, but a fun working environment can help retain workers
