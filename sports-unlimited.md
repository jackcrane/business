# Sports Unlimited

## Define the marketing challenge

Glenkowsky has to determine how to grow the demand for Unlimited's soccer fields, leagues, and bubbled fields. He needs to determine:

1. What additional soccer ptential could he tap into?
2. What are possible additional uses for the facilities?
3. Who might use the facilities for each of these possible additional uses

How might Glenkowsky use all of his availible resources to continue to grow the demand.

## What do you believe led to the poor performance?

Poor marketing/advertisements and not analyzing the roi. Incorrect target market (old people tend to read the newspaper, old people usually don't play soccer)

Being irresponsible with money.

## Identify Opportunities

Other potential opportunities is to tap into other sports
- Lacrosse
- Football
- Fhockey
- Baseball
- Track & field
- Ultimate Frisbee
- Capture the flag
- Badminton
- Field Volleyball
- Tennis
- Rugby
- Softball
- Camps and other activities
  - Activities for old people

Referral programs for existing programs, or a frequent user program

Waive fees for first-year teams to get them into the league

Set up a potential membership program.

## Segment the market

Needs to focus on younger people who are more into sports. Segment into the age groups.. Market fun summer activities to kids, market the leagues to teens, and market general "stay-in-shape" activities to old people.

## Competition

Competition is weak, could try to poach teams from other leagues, and by providing a better experience with an easier way to watch than the opponent's facilities.
