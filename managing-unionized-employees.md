# Labor Unions

- Employee organizations formed to achieve better pay, hours, and working conditions
- On average, union workers make about $200 more than nonunion workers
- Union growth has slowed in recent years; prospects for growth are not good
- Significant aspects of HRM, particularly compensation, are dictated by Union contracts.

## Resolving disputes

### Labor tactics

- Picketing
- Strikes
- Boycotts

## Management tactics

- Lockout
- Strikebreakers

## Outside resolution

- Conciliation
  - Brings in a third party to keep the management and laborers talking
  - Third party holds little power over either, just facilitates communications
- Mediation
  - More hands-on version of conciliation, 3rd party offers suggestion
- Arbitration
  - Mediation, but the decision of the 3rd party's suggestion is legally binding.
