# Freshii

HQ Uses a flat organizational structure, allowing higher speed of execution and lower costs.

Execs, engineers, department heads, and workers all work in a communal space. There are no junior positions, and all employees have stock in (publicly traded) freshii, giving them a vested interest in the company.

Workers own projects from ideation to development, research, execution and monitoring the success of their product.

## Franchise-based model

Franchises must be in line with the goal of the company. Store leaders are told to look at their teams and find a way to make everyone a leader.

Allows the company to be decentralized and helps the workers in the hq lead the company without having to manage the individual stores while still maintaining their flat structure.
